Creating a complete Laravel application with all the required functionalities is beyond the scope of a single response, but I can guide you through the process step by step.

Here's a simplified outline of how you could structure your Pizza Ordering System:

Create Database and Migrations:

Set up your database configuration in .env.
Create migrations for pizzas, sizes, toppings, orders, and order_items tables.
Define Models and Relationships:

Define relationships between models: Pizza, Size, Topping, Order, OrderItem.
Use model relationships like hasMany, belongsTo, etc.
Database Seeding:

Create seeders to populate the pizzas, sizes, and toppings tables with sample data.
Create Routes and Controllers:

Define routes for ordering pizzas, adding toppings, and calculating totals.
Create controllers for handling these routes.
Views and Blade Templates:

Create Blade views for ordering pizzas, adding toppings, and displaying order details.
Implement Logic:

Implement logic in controllers to handle ordering pizzas, adding toppings, calculating totals, and storing orders in the database.
Here's a simplified example of how you might structure the code:

php
Copy code
// routes/web.php
Route::get('/', 'PizzaController@index');
Route::post('/order', 'PizzaController@order');

// PizzaController.php
public function index()
{
    $pizzas = Pizza::all();
    $sizes = Size::all();
    $toppings = Topping::all();

    return view('order.index', compact('pizzas', 'sizes', 'toppings'));
}

public function order(Request $request)
{
    // Process the order, calculate the total amount, and store in the database
    // ...

    return redirect('/')->with('success', 'Order placed successfully!');
}
Remember, this is a high-level overview. You'll need to create views, implement validation, handle form submissions, calculate prices, and handle database operations properly.

For a complete implementation, I recommend following Laravel's documentation and tutorials. It's a great resource to learn how to create a fully functional Laravel application step by step: Laravel Documentation.

Additionally, you can find Laravel tutorials on various platforms and online courses to help you build and understand each aspect of the Pizza Ordering System.
